# sti builder image requirements

The main advantage of using sti for building reproducible docker images is ease
of use for the developer. To meet that criteria you, as a builder image author,
should be aware of the two basic requirements for the best possible sti
performance. These are:

* [required image contents](#required-image-contents)
* [sti scripts](#sti-scripts)


# Required image contents

The build process consists of three fundamental elements which are combined into the
final docker image. These are: source code, sti scripts, and the builder image. Duringthe
build process sti must place sources and scripts inside that builder image. To do
so sti creates a tar file containing the two and then streams that file into the
builder image. Before executing the `assemble` script, sti untars that file and places
its contents into the destination specified with `--destination` flag or the value of 
the `io.s2i.destination` label set in the builder image (the default destination is `/tmp`).
If your image does not have either `tar` or `/bin/sh` the sti build will perform an additional
docker build to place the source code and scripts into an appropriate image and then run
the normal sti build.

The following diagram illustrates the build workflow:

![sti workflow](./sti-flow.png "sti workflow")

\* Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and (opionally) artifacts
and invoke the `assemble` script. If this is the second run after any previous runs with
`tar`/`/bin/sh` errors, it will only run the `assemble` script, since both the source and
scripts are already present.


# sti scripts

`sti` expects you (the builder image author) to supply the following scripts:

* required:
    * [assemble](#assemble)
    * [run](#run)
* optional:
    * [save-artifacts](#save-artifacts)
    * [usage](#usage)
    * [test/run](#test/run)

All of the scripts can be written in any programming language, as long as the scripts
are executable inside the builder image. The build searches the following locations for
these scripts in the following order:

1. The supplied `--scripts-url` URL (if supplied as an argument)
1. The application source's `.sti/bin` directory (if it exists)
1. The default image URL (ie the value of the image's `io.s2i.scripts-url` label)

Both the `io.s2i.scripts-url` label specified in the image and the `--scripts-url` flag
can be supplied in any of the following ways to indicate where the STI scripts are located:

* `image://path_to_scripts_dir` - absolute path inside the image
* `file://path_to_scripts_dir` - relative or absolute path on the host machine
* `http(s)://path_to_scripts_dir` - URL to a directory

**NOTE**: In the case where the scripts are already placed inside the image (ie when
using the `--scripts-url` flag or the `io.s2i.scripts-url` label with the format
`image:///path/in/image`), then the `--destination` flag or the `io.s2i.destination`
label applies only to sources and artifacts.

## assemble

The `assemble` script is responsible for building the application artifacts from source,
and placing them into the appropriate directories inside the image. The workflow for the
`assemble` script is:

1. Restore build artifacts (in case you want to support incremental builds (if using this,
   make sure you define [save-artifacts](#save-artifacts)) as well.
1. Place the application source code in the appropriate location.
1. Build any application artifacts.
1. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for running.

#### Example `assemble` script:

**NOTE**: All the examples are written in [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
and it is assumed that the tar is unpacked into the `/tmp/sti` directory.

```
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts
if [ "$(ls /tmp/sti/artifacts/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    mv /tmp/sti/artifacts/* $HOME/.
fi

# move the application source
mv /tmp/sti/src $HOME/src

# build application artifacts
pushd ${HOME}
make all

# install the artifacts
make install
popd
```

## run

The `run` script is responsible for executing your application.

#### Example `run` script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# run the application
/opt/application/run.sh
```

## save-artifacts

The `save-artifacts` script is responsible for gathering all the dependencies whose
existence can speed up the build processes (eg for Ruby-gems installed by Bundler,
maven caches for Java builds) into a tar file and streaming it to standard output.

#### Example `save-artifacts` script:

```
#!/bin/bash

pushd ${HOME}
if [ -d deps ]; then
    # all deps contents to tar stream
    tar cf - deps
fi
popd

```

## usage

The `usage` script is for you (as the builder image author) to inform the user
how to use your image.

#### Example `usage` script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# inform the user how to use the image
cat <<EOF
This is a STI sample builder image, to use it, install
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image
EOF
```

## test/run

The `test/run` script is for you (as the builder image author) to create a simple
process to check whether the image is working correctly. The workflow of that process
should be the following:

1. Build the image.
1. Run the image to verify the `usage` script.
1. Run the `sti build` to verify `assemble` script.
1. (Optional) Run the `sti build` once more to verify `save-artifacts` script and
   `assemble`'s restore artifacts functionality.
1. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

**NOTE** The suggested place to put your test application built by your
`test/run` script is `test/test-app` in your image repository, see
[sti create](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create).
